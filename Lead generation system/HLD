## System Design & Tool Selection

**Recommended Tools:**

- **Lead Capture:** Use Google Ads Lead Form Extensions with webhook integration for real-time lead delivery[2][3][7][12].
- **Workflow Automation:** Platforms like Zapier or Make.com to automate data flows between Google Ads, CRM, voice call tools, and calendars[5][6][9][10].
- **Voice Call Triggering:** Twilio or similar programmable voice platforms to initiate automated outbound calls and deliver scripts.
- **Appointment Scheduling:** Calendly or Google Calendar integration for real-time appointment booking.
- **Lead Tracking:** Google Sheets or a lightweight CRM (e.g., HubSpot, Salesforce) for status tracking and reporting[3][7][12].

**Integration Workflow:**

1. Google Ads Lead Form submission triggers a webhook.
2. Webhook sends lead data to an automation platform (Zapier/Make).
3. Automation initiates:
   - Immediate outbound voice call via Twilio.
   - Lead data entry into CRM/Google Sheet.
   - Appointment scheduling workflow.
4. Follow-up sequences and reminders handled by automation platform.
5. All activities logged in a shared dashboard.

## Lead Capture

- **Implementation:** Set up Google Ads Lead Form Extensions to collect name, contact info, submission time, and campaign source[2][7][12].
- **Integration:** Use webhook to push lead data instantly to your CRM or a Google Sheet for centralized storage and processing[2][3][9][12].

---

## Voice Call Triggering

- **Automation:** Upon lead capture, trigger Twilio (or similar) to call the lead immediately.
- **Scripted Call:** Use a pre-recorded or AI-driven script to:
  - Introduce your company.
  - Qualify the lead (ask key questions).
  - Offer appointment scheduling.
- **Fallback:** If call is unanswered, trigger SMS or email follow-up.

---

## Appointment Handling

- **Calendar Integration:** Sync Twilio (or automation platform) with Calendly or Google Calendar.
- **Booking Options:** Allow leads to book via phone keypad, SMS, or email link.
- **Tracking:** Log all scheduled appointments in a shared calendar and CRM/Sheet for team visibility.

---

## Follow-Up Logic

- **Missed Calls:** If the lead does not answer, automatically send a follow-up SMS/email with a booking link.
- **Reminders:** Schedule additional follow-up attempts (calls, SMS, or emails) at defined intervals.
- **Escalation:** If no response after a set number of attempts, escalate to a team member for manual outreach.

---

## Lead Tracking & Reporting

- **Dashboard:** Use Google Sheets or CRM dashboard to log:
  - Lead status (new, contacted, qualified, scheduled, etc.)
  - Voice call result (answered, missed, declined)
  - Appointment status (scheduled, completed, no-show)
  - Follow-up attempts and outcomes[3][7][9][12].
- **Access:** Share dashboard with the AES team for real-time updates and collaboration.

---

## Testing & Handover

- **End-to-End Testing:** Simulate lead submissions and verify all automations (capture, call, booking, follow-up, reporting).
- **Documentation:** Provide step-by-step guides, workflow diagrams, and access credentials.
- **Training:** Optional live or recorded session for AES staff to ensure smooth adoption.

## Best Practices

- Use webhook integration for real-time lead delivery and minimal manual effort[2][3][7][12].
- Automate as much of the workflow as possible to improve speed and consistency[5][6][9][10].
- Regularly test and refine scripts and follow-up sequences to maximize conversions.
- Ensure all data handling complies with privacy and consent requirements.

This system will significantly reduce response time, increase conversion rates, and maximize your return on advertising spend by ensuring every lead is engaged instantly and efficiently.
